## Pentagons

### (As)<sub>2</sub>B(sA)<sub>2</sub>t pentagons family

Simple family of pentagons. Each member can be described
with a *single* positive real number **r**.
The pentagons have four identical angles **A**, four identical sides **s**,
a fifth angle **B** and a fifth side **t**. In all these pentagons:

* r = B / A
* B = 3&pi; + 4A
* t = 2s(cos(A) - cos(2A))

Both the *regular* pentagon {5} and the *equilateral* pentagram {5/2} 
belong to the family.

See [(As)<sub>2</sub>B(sA)<sub>2</sub>t]((As)2B(sA)2t.html).

### AsBsCsDsEs pentagons family

All the *equilateral* pentagons.

A more complex family of pentagons. Each member can be described with *two* 
positive real numbers **r1** and **r2**.
The pentagons have the five sides equal **s** but can have the five
angles **A**, **B**, **C**, **D**, **E** different.

See [AsBsCsDsEs](AsBsCsDsEs.html).

## Hexagons

## Heptagons

### (As)<sub>3</sub>B(sA)<sub>3</sub>t heptagons family

Simple family of heptagons. Each member can be described
with a *single* positive real number **r**.
The heptagons have six identical angles **A**, six identical sides **s**,
a seventh angle **B** and a seventh side **t**. In all these heptagons

* r = B / A
* B = 5&pi; + 6A
* t = 2s(cos(A) - cos(2A) + cos(3A))

The *regular* heptagon and the two *equilateral* heptagrams {7/2} and {7/3} belong to this family.
